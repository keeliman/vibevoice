# Smart Sync

Synchronize project intelligently with conflict resolution and collaboration features: $ARGUMENTS

## 🎯 Smart Sync Detection

### 1. **Automatic Sync Types**
```bash
/sync                    # Sync with remote repository
/sync "pull"             # Pull latest changes
/sync "push"             # Push local changes
/sync "merge"            # Merge remote changes
/sync "conflicts"        # Resolve conflicts
/sync "backup"           # Create backup before sync
```

### 2. **Intelligent Sync Mapping**
```yaml
# Auto-detected sync operations
🔄 Sync Operations:
├── 📥 Pull Operations
│   ├── pull: Fetch and merge
│   ├── fetch: Fetch only
│   └── rebase: Pull with rebase
├── 📤 Push Operations
│   ├── push: Push to remote
│   ├── force: Force push
│   └── tags: Push tags
├── 🔀 Merge Operations
│   ├── merge: Merge branches
│   ├── conflicts: Resolve conflicts
│   └── rebase: Interactive rebase
└── 💾 Backup Operations
    ├── backup: Create backup
    ├── restore: Restore from backup
    └── diff: Show differences
```

### 3. **Smart Sync Strategies**

#### **Safe Sync**
```bash
/sync
# Automatically:
# - Create backup
# - Pull latest changes
# - Resolve conflicts
# - Push local changes
# - Validate sync
```

#### **Conflict Resolution**
```bash
/sync "conflicts"
# Automatically:
# - Detect conflicts
# - Analyze conflict types
# - Suggest resolutions
# - Apply fixes
# - Validate resolution
```

#### **Backup Sync**
```bash
/sync "backup"
# Automatically:
# - Create timestamped backup
# - Sync with remote
# - Validate backup integrity
# - Clean old backups
```

## 🔧 Intelligent Synchronization

### **Pre-Sync Analysis**
```yaml
# Automated pre-sync checks
- Local changes detection
- Remote changes analysis
- Conflict prediction
- Backup requirements
- Network connectivity
```

### **Conflict Detection & Resolution**
```bash
# Smart conflict handling
⚠️  Conflict detected in src/auth/login.js
💡 Analysis: Both modified same function
🔧 Resolution: Merge both changes intelligently

⚠️  Conflict detected in package.json
💡 Analysis: Different dependency versions
🔧 Resolution: Use latest compatible versions

⚠️  Conflict detected in README.md
💡 Analysis: Documentation overlap
🔧 Resolution: Combine both versions
```

### **Sync Monitoring**
```bash
# Real-time sync progress
🔄 Syncing with remote...
├── Backup: ✅ (0.5s)
├── Fetch: ✅ (2.1s)
├── Merge: ✅ (1.8s)
├── Conflicts: ✅ (0.3s)
└── Push: ✅ (1.2s)

📊 Sync Results:
├── Files synced: 23
├── Conflicts resolved: 2
├── Backup created: sync-backup-2024-01-30
└── Time: 5.9s
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### **Standard Synchronization**
```bash
# Sync with remote
/sync

# Pull latest changes
/sync "pull"

# Push local changes
/sync "push"

# Merge remote changes
/sync "merge"
```

### **Conflict Management**
```bash
# Resolve conflicts
/sync "conflicts"

# Interactive conflict resolution
/sync "conflicts --interactive"

# Auto-resolve conflicts
/sync "conflicts --auto"
```

### **Backup Operations**
```bash
# Create backup before sync
/sync "backup"

# Restore from backup
/sync "restore sync-backup-2024-01-30"

# List available backups
/sync "backup --list"
```

## 🔍 Sync Analysis

### **Change Analysis**
```yaml
# Comprehensive change analysis
- Local changes summary
- Remote changes summary
- Conflict prediction
- Impact assessment
- Risk evaluation
```

### **Conflict Analysis**
```yaml
# Conflict identification
- File-level conflicts
- Line-level conflicts
- Semantic conflicts
- Dependency conflicts
- Configuration conflicts
```

## 📊 Sync Analytics

### **Performance Metrics**
```yaml
# Sync performance tracking
- Sync execution time

```bash
# Sync specific files
/sync "src/components/"

# Sync specific branches
/sync "feature/auth"

# Sync with filters
/sync "*.js"
/sync "!node_modules/"
```

### **Batch Operations**
```bash
# Sync multiple repositories
/sync "repo1 repo2 repo3"

# Sync with conditions
/sync "if-changed"
/sync "staged-only"

# Sync with priorities
/sync "critical"
/sync "important"
/sync "optional"
```

### **Collaboration Features**
```bash
# Team sync
/sync "team"

# Branch sync
/sync "branches"

# Tag sync
/sync "tags"
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### **Backup Management**
```yaml
# Backup strategies
- Automatic backup creation
- Incremental backups
- Backup rotation
- Backup validation
- Restore capabilities
```

### **Conflict Prevention**
```yaml
# Conflict prevention
- Pre-sync conflict detection
- Change impact analysis
