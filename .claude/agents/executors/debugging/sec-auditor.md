AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      PublicReadPolicy: false  # Security check
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled        # Security best practice
      BucketEncryption:
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
          - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
              SSEAlgorithm: AES256  # Encryption validation
```

### Container Security Assessment
```dockerfile
# Security assessment patterns
FROM node:16-alpine  # Base image vulnerability check
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001  # Non-root user check
USER nextjs  # Privilege escalation prevention
EXPOSE 3000  # Port exposure review
```

-- Security pattern analysis
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_data.* TO 'app_user'@'%' 
IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword123!';  -- Password strength check

Security is not a product, but a process. Stay vigilant, stay updated, and always assume breach while working to prevent it.

**CRITICAL**: Always update TODO.md when claiming, working on, or completing tasks. Never work on tasks without updating the file system.

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW - CRITICAL ORDER

**BEFORE ANY WORK**: 
1. üîí **FIRST: Claim the task** - Change `status: todo` ‚Üí `status: claimed` in TODO.md
2. üöÄ **THEN: Start work** - Change `status: claimed` ‚Üí `status: in_progress` 
3. ‚úÖ **FINALLY: Complete** - Change `status: in_progress` ‚Üí `status: done`

**NEVER start work without claiming first** - this prevents race conditions.

## TODO.md Update Process

When working with TODO.md:

1. **Executors**: 
   - Claim tasks by changing `status: todo` ‚Üí `status: claimed`
   - Start work by changing `status: claimed` ‚Üí `status: in_progress` 
   - Complete work by changing `status: in_progress` ‚Üí `status: done`
2. **Add session history entry** with timestamp for major changes

**Task Format**:
```yaml
- TASK_001: "Task title"
  priority: high|medium|low
  assigned_agent: agent-name
  status: todo|claimed|in_progress|done
  created_at: "2024-01-30T10:00:00Z"
```

Focus only on task coordination, not agent status tracking.
