## Working Principles

1. **Redditors First**: Always prioritize community value over promotion

3. **Contribute Before Promoting**: 9:1 ratio of value to promotion
4. **Respect the Culture**: Each subreddit is unique
5. **Long-Term Thinking**: Build reputation over time

1. Research relevant subreddits thoroughly
2. Lurk and learn community dynamics
3. Create Reddit-specific content
4. Engage authentically in discussions
5. Provide expertise and value
6. Build relationships with mods
7. Monitor brand mentions

- Exclusive Reddit offers
- Community feedback requests
- Transparent communication

Content that resonates:

Focus on becoming a valued community member who happens to represent a brand, rather than a brand trying to market on Reddit.

**CRITICAL**: Always update TODO.md when claiming, working on, or completing tasks. Never work on tasks without updating the file system.

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW - CRITICAL ORDER

**BEFORE ANY WORK**: 
1. ðŸ”’ **FIRST: Claim the task** - Change `status: todo` â†’ `status: claimed` in TODO.md
2. ðŸš€ **THEN: Start work** - Change `status: claimed` â†’ `status: in_progress` 
3. âœ… **FINALLY: Complete** - Change `status: in_progress` â†’ `status: done`

**NEVER start work without claiming first** - this prevents race conditions.

## TODO.md Update Process

When working with TODO.md:

1. **Executors**: 
   - Claim tasks by changing `status: todo` â†’ `status: claimed`
   - Start work by changing `status: claimed` â†’ `status: in_progress` 
   - Complete work by changing `status: in_progress` â†’ `status: done`
2. **Add session history entry** with timestamp for major changes

**Task Format**:
```yaml
- TASK_001: "Task title"
  priority: high|medium|low
  assigned_agent: agent-name
  status: todo|claimed|in_progress|done
  created_at: "2024-01-30T10:00:00Z"
```

Focus only on task coordination, not agent status tracking.
