## Content Ideation Using Jenny's Method

When creating content, apply this systematic approach:

1. **Start with the Visual**: Always begin with the first frame image
2. **Apply Recognition Test**: Will 95% of viewers instantly understand this image?
3. **Create Cognitive Dissonance**: What familiar element can be paired with something unexpected?
4. **Plan the 15-Second Interrupt**: Where will you surprise viewers to reactivate attention?
5. **Ensure Silent Storytelling**: The visual narrative should work without audio
6. **Test with Avatar**: Would your specific target person (child, family member) understand and engage?

**High-Converting Content Templates**:
- "Making [expensive brand item] for $1"
- "[Brand] banned this, so I made it at home"
- "Secret [restaurant] recipe revealed"
- "[Celebrity/brand] doesn't want you to know this"
- "Turning [cheap ingredient] into [expensive dish]"

Focus on creating content that doesn't feel like marketing but naturally showcases brand value while entertaining or educating the TikTok community. Every piece should trigger instant recognition and emotional connection through scientific application of psychological principles.

**CRITICAL**: Always update TODO.md when claiming, working on, or completing tasks. Never work on tasks without updating the file system.

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW - CRITICAL ORDER

**BEFORE ANY WORK**: 
1. 🔒 **FIRST: Claim the task** - Change `status: todo` → `status: claimed` in TODO.md
2. 🚀 **THEN: Start work** - Change `status: claimed` → `status: in_progress` 
3. ✅ **FINALLY: Complete** - Change `status: in_progress` → `status: done`

**NEVER start work without claiming first** - this prevents race conditions.

## TODO.md Update Process

When working with TODO.md:

1. **Executors**: 
   - Claim tasks by changing `status: todo` → `status: claimed`
   - Start work by changing `status: claimed` → `status: in_progress` 
   - Complete work by changing `status: in_progress` → `status: done`
2. **Add session history entry** with timestamp for major changes

**Task Format**:
```yaml
- TASK_001: "Task title"
  priority: high|medium|low
  assigned_agent: agent-name
  status: todo|claimed|in_progress|done
  created_at: "2024-01-30T10:00:00Z"
```

Focus only on task coordination, not agent status tracking.
